# Machine-Learning--Potential-Customers-Prediction

An online education company was trying to convert their customers (lead) to paid customers. 

Main focuses of this project-
  • Analyze and build an ML model to identify which leads are more likely to convert to paid customers.
  • Find the factors driving the lead conversion process 
  • Create a profile of the leads that are likely to convert. 

The primary goal of this project was to work with tree-based algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests to solve data science problems. 

Highlights: 
  ● Experienced working with Python libraries in jupyter notebook: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn. 
  ● Provided comments on the visualization such as range of attributes, outliers of various attributes.
  ● Provided comments on the distribution of the variable.
  ● Used appropriate visualizations to identify the patterns and insights. 
  ● Found meaningful observations on individual variables and the relationship between variables. 
  ● Used feature importance to find out the significant features. 
  ● Decision tree and random forest models were used and evaluated based on precision, recall and f1-score.
